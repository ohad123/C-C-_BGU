# C and C++ Projects - Ben-Gurion University

Welcome to my repository of C and C++ projects from Ben-Gurion University. This collection includes various projects that demonstrate core programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, memory management, and operator overloading.

## Projects

1. **[Shape - OOP](https://github.com/ohad123/C_and_Cpp_BGU/tree/main/Shape%20-%20OOP)**
   - **Description:** Implements a hierarchy of geometric shapes using object-oriented programming concepts. Includes classes for `Shape`, `Square`, `Circle`, and `OrthogonalTriangle`, as well as a menu class to interact with these shapes.
   - **Key Concepts:** Inheritance, polymorphism, pure virtual functions.

2. **[Operator Overloading and Vectors](https://github.com/ohad123/C_and_Cpp_BGU/tree/main/Operator%20overloading%20and%20vectors)**
   - **Description:** Demonstrates operator overloading with a `VectorExample` class. Includes overloading for addition, subtraction, equality, and output stream operators.
   - **Key Concepts:** Operator overloading, class methods.

3. **[Vending Machine](https://github.com/ohad123/C_and_Cpp_BGU/tree/main/Vending%20Machine)**
   - **Description:** Simulates a vending machine with functionalities to select products, insert coins, complete transactions, view inventory, and cancel transactions.
   - **Key Concepts:** Class design, state management, user interaction.

4. **[Memory Allocation and Linked Lists](https://github.com/ohad123/C_and_Cpp_BGU/tree/main/Memory%20allocation%20and%20linked%20lists)**
   - **Description:** Implements a linked list with operations to add, delete, search, and print nodes. Emphasizes proper memory management practices.
   - **Key Concepts:** Dynamic memory allocation, linked list operations, memory management.

5. **[Checkers Game](https://github.com/ohad123/C_and_Cpp_BGU/tree/main/Checkers%20game)**
   - **Description:** Implements a checkers game with functionalities for moving pawns, capturing opponentâ€™s pawns, and checking game status.
   - **Key Concepts:** Game logic, board management, user interaction.
